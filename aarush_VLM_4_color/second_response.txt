Rotate towards segment 19, walk into the bathroom towards the furthest point.
Rotate towards segment 11, walk into the bathroom towards the toilet cistern on the back wall.
Rotate towards segment 3, walk towards the back wall of the bathroom.
Rotate towards segment 9, walk towards the sink in the bathroom.
Rotate towards segment 13, walk towards the corner of the bathroom.

My primary goal is to efficiently explore the new room (a bathroom) that I am facing. The best strategy is to move as far as possible into this new space with a single action, while ensuring a clear path.

First, I discarded all segments that are obstacles or not on the exploration path. This includes the door frames (0, 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 15, 16), the floor (1, 10), and the ceiling (8).

My ranking of the remaining viable segments is based on their distance, prioritizing the furthest points to maximize exploration progress.
1.  **Segment 19** is ranked first as it is by far the most distant point at 6.99m. Aiming for the deepest point in a room is the most efficient way to explore.
2.  **Segment 11** (2.97m) and **Segment 3** (2.94m) are ranked next. They represent the back wall of the bathroom and are the next furthest targets.
3.  **Segment 9** (the sink at 2.45m) and **Segment 13** (a corner at 2.80m) are also good targets within the room, but they are closer than the back wall, making them slightly less efficient choices for a first move into the space.

I have chosen a travel distance of 2.00 meters. The doorway is less than 1 meter away, and the sink is at 2.45m. A 2.00m move will safely place me well inside the bathroom, past the doorway, and provide an excellent new vantage point without risking a collision with the sink or the back wall.
