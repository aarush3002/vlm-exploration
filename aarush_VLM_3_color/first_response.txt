4,5,3,7,6,8,1,2,0
not decision point
My analysis of the occupancy map and images shows that I am currently at node 3, the end of a hallway. This location is a dead end, blocked by a closed door (Image 0). To continue my primary mission of exploring new areas, it is necessary for me to backtrack to a previous junction where other unexplored paths exist.

Therefore, my ranking prioritizes the most efficient route for backtracking.
Image 4 is ranked highest as it provides the most direct, centered path back down the hallway towards nodes 2 and 1.
Images 5 and 3 are ranked next; they also point back down the hallway and are viable for backtracking, but their angles are less direct than Image 4.
The remaining images are ranked low because they are unsuitable for progress. Images 7 and 6 point inefficiently towards previously explored areas. Images 8, 1, 2, and 0 all point directly at impassable obstacles like walls, corners, and the closed door itself.

This is not a decision point because there are no new, unexplored, and accessible directions from my current location. The only logical course of action is to backtrack.
