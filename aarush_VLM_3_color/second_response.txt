Rotate towards segment 17, walk into the unexplored room on the left.
Rotate towards segment 12, walk into the new room on the left.
Rotate towards segment 13, walk through the doorway on the left to enter the new room.
Rotate towards segment 10, walk through the left doorway to begin exploring the room.

My primary goal is to explore new areas. Having backtracked from two dead ends (the end of the hallway and the bathroom at node 2), I am now at the junction (node 1) where an unexplored room is visible to my left. The path straight ahead leads to the bathroom I have already visited. Therefore, my priority is to enter the new room on the left.

Segments 17 and 12 are ranked highest because they are the furthest points visible (4.90m and 4.75m) through this new doorway. Targeting them provides the most direct and efficient path deep into the unexplored space. I've chosen a travel distance of 4.00m to ensure I make significant progress into this new room.

Segments 13 and 10 are the doorframes of this same new room. While they are valid navigational targets to enter the room, they are ranked lower because they are closer and less direct than aiming for the interior. The shorter travel distances are set to ensure I clear the doorway and enter the new area. All other segments were discarded as they are part of the path to the already-explored bathroom, are walls, or are obstacles.
