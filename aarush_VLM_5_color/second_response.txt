My goal is to explore new areas. Having determined that the previous room was a dead end, I have turned to face the only available exit path, which is a long hallway. The most efficient way to continue exploration is to proceed down this hallway.

First, I have discarded all non-viable segments, such as the nearby walls (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 18, 19) and the floor (5).

The remaining viable segments are all located at the far end of the hallway. I have ranked them based on their distance, prioritizing the furthest points to maximize my progress in a single move.
1.  **Segment 15** (3.80m) is ranked first as it is the most distant point I can see on the door at the end of the hall.
2.  **Segments 8, 13, 14, 9, 10, and 17** are also excellent targets at the far end of the hallway, and are ranked in descending order of their distance.

I have chosen a travel distance of 3.00 meters. This will move me most of the way down the hallway, allowing me to map this new space efficiently while stopping safely before I collide with the closed door at the end (approx. 3.8m away).
