not decision point

My main goal is to explore new areas, but I am currently in a small bathroom (node 5) which appears to be a dead end. The occupancy map and the visual information confirm that there are no other exits. To continue my exploration, I must backtrack through the doorway I used to enter.

1.  **Image 4** is ranked first because it offers the clearest, most direct path out of this dead-end room and back towards node 4. This is the only action that allows for future exploration.
2.  **Image 3** is the second-best option. It also points towards the exit doorway but is angled more towards the wall, making it a slightly less efficient path out.
3.  **Image 5** is ranked third. It also looks toward the exit but is mostly obstructed by the door frame, making it a poor choice for navigation.
4.  **Images 1, 2, 0, 8, 7, and 6** are all ranked last because they point at various walls and obstacles within the small, already-explored bathroom. Moving in these directions would accomplish nothing and likely lead to a collision. They offer no path forward for exploration.

This is "not a decision point" because there is only one reasonable course of action: to leave the current dead-end room. There are no alternative unexplored paths from my current location.
