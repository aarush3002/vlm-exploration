1,0,3,4,2,5,6,8,7
decision point
My primary objective is to explore new areas as quickly as possible. Image 1 is ranked first because it shows a clear and open doorway, which represents the greatest potential for accessing a large, new, unexplored area, a fact supported by the occupancy map. Image 0 is ranked second; while it faces the wall next to the door, it provides a clear path that moves me closer to the primary exit point shown in Image 1. Image 3 is the next best option as it shows a secondary, but still viable, path for exploration along the side of the bed, which the map indicates leads to unexplored space. Image 4 is a slightly less optimal version of Image 3, heading more directly into a corner. The remaining images (2, 5, 6, 8, 7) are ranked lowest because they all point towards large, immediate obstacles like the bed and a dresser, offering little to no navigable space and preventing any meaningful exploration. This is a "decision point" because there are two distinct and reasonable paths to take: one through the doorway (Image 1) and another alongside the bed (Image 3).
