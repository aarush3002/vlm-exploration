My primary goal is to explore new areas, and the open doorway represents the most significant opportunity for this. Segments 12 and 16 are the best targets as they are the furthest points visible through that doorway (4.00m and 4.02m respectively), indicating a clear path into a new room. I have ranked 12 slightly higher as it is more centrally located in the visible path. The travel distance is set to 3.50m to ensure I move well into the new space without colliding with the far wall. Segments 5 (doorframe) and 11 (wall next to the door) are ranked next as they are valid navigational points that guide me towards and through the same optimal doorway. The distances for these are shorter, designed to position me correctly to pass through the opening. All other segments were discarded as they are either obstacles (bed, table), non-traversable surfaces (walls, floor, ceiling), or lead away from the most promising path of exploration.
