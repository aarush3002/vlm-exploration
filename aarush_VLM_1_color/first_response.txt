2,1,3,4,5,0,8,6,7
not decision point
My primary goal is to discover new, unexplored areas. Based on the occupancy map and the images, there is one clear path forward that leads to a large, unknown area.

Image 2 is ranked first as it looks directly down this unexplored hallway, offering the most efficient and direct path for new exploration. The map confirms this is a significant frontier.

Image 1 is ranked second. It is also pointed down the same promising hallway as Image 2, just from a slightly different angle. It remains a highly viable option for continuing exploration.

Image 3 is ranked third because, while it is cluttered by the cabinet on the right, its general vector is still towards the new hallway, making it a less optimal but still forward-progressing choice.

Images 4 and 5 are ranked lower because they point back towards the room I just came from (node 0 on the traversal graph). Moving in these directions would be backtracking, which is inefficient for my goal of finding new areas.

Images 0, 8, 6, and 7 are ranked last as they all face immediate obstacles like walls, corners, or a closed door, offering no path for forward movement or exploration.

This is not a decision point because there is only one clear and reasonable direction for new exploration (the hallway shown in images 1 and 2). All other paths are either blocked or lead back to a previously visited location.
