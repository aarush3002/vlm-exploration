Rotate towards segment 6, walk through the doorway into the room ahead.
Rotate towards segment 5, walk into the room ahead.
Rotate towards segment 10, walk through the doorway into the room on the left.
Rotate towards segment 9, walk into the room on the left.

My goal is to explore new areas, and the current view presents two clear opportunities: a doorway straight ahead and a doorway to the left. I am prioritizing the path that appears to offer the most new space to explore.

Segments 6 and 5 are ranked highest because they are inside the far doorway and have the greatest depth (approx. 3.5m). This suggests a larger room or a longer path, making it the most promising direction for exploration. I have chosen a travel distance of 3.00m to move well into this new area.

Segments 10 and 9 are the next best options. They are located inside the doorway on the left, representing a second, distinct, and unexplored area. Their distance is shorter (approx. 2.1m), so I have ranked them after the farther doorway. A travel distance of 1.80m is selected to enter this room.

All other segments have been discarded because they represent walls, close obstacles, doorframes, or the floor, none of which are suitable targets for my exploration objective.
