Rotate towards segment 11, walk down the hallway towards the end door.
Rotate towards segment 12, walk down the hallway towards the door's window.
Rotate towards segment 4, walk towards the end of the hallway.
Rotate towards segment 7, walk along the hallway.

My goal is to continue exploring new areas after leaving the dead-end bathroom. The current view shows a long, straight hallway, which is the only viable path forward. My strategy is to travel to the end of this hallway.

The highest-ranked segments (11, 12, 4) are all located on the door at the far end of the hallway, with distances around 3.5 meters. These are the ideal targets as they represent the furthest point in this direction and a potential gateway to a new area. I have prioritized segment 11 as it is the main panel of the door, making it a central and stable target. Segment 7, a distant wall, is also a reasonable target as it aligns with the same path of travel.

A travel distance of 3.00 meters is chosen for all targets. This will move me almost the entire length of the hallway, positioning me to assess the door at the end without colliding with it. All other segments were discarded because they represent nearby walls, doorframes, or the floor, which are not suitable destinations for my primary objective of rapid exploration.
