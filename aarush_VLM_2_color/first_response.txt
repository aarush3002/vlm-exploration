not decision point
My primary objective is to explore new areas. The traversal graph and the occupancy map show that my current location (node 2) is a small, dead-end room (a bathroom). There are no new exits or paths forward from this room. Therefore, to continue my exploration mission, I must backtrack to the previous junction in the hallway (node 1) to access other unexplored frontiers.

Images 5 and 4 are ranked highest because they show the clearest and most direct path back out of the bathroom and into the hallway, which is the necessary step to find new areas. Image 5 is slightly better as it is more centered on the hallway.

Image 3 is ranked next; it also points towards the exit but is aimed at the wall/doorframe, making it a less efficient path out.

Images 2 and 1 are ranked lower because they lead further into the dead-end room. While this would map the room more completely, it is inefficient as it moves me away from the only exit and thus away from any new potential areas for exploration.

The remaining images (6, 0, 8, 7) are ranked lowest because they are aimed directly at non-traversable obstacles like walls, a closed door, a chair, and a dresser.
