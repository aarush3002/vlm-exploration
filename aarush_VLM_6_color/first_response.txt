exploration complete
not decision point

I have reached the end of a long hallway (node 6), and I am facing a closed exterior door (Image 0). A full scan of my surroundings confirms that there are no new, unexplored, accessible areas. Image 4 points back towards node 5, the path I just traveled. All other images (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) show walls or previously explored rooms. The traversal graph confirms that all accessible nodes have been visited, and the occupancy map shows no significant gray areas that represent unmapped, accessible spaces. Therefore, I have concluded that the exploration of this environment is complete.
