  # Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 0.8           # Reduced significantly. Makes the planner more reactive and less worried about distant walls.

  # Trajectory Scoring Parameters
  # These weights make the planner prioritize reaching the goal over perfectly following the path, giving it more freedom to maneuver.
  occdist_scale: 0.0     # Be slightly less afraid of obstacles
  pdist_scale: 0.6        # Care a bit less about staying on the exact global path
  gdist_scale: 1.0        # Care a lot more about making progress towards the goal
