# Parameters for the default global planner (global_planner/GlobalPlanner)
GlobalPlanner:
  # This is the most important parameter for exploration.
  # It allows move_base to create a plan to a goal even if that goal is in "unknown" space.
  # Since frontiers are by definition on the edge of unknown space, this is critical.
  allow_unknown: true

  # Use the quadratic calculation for the potential field. It's generally better.
  use_quadratic: true

  # Use a grid path, which is more reliable for grid-based planners.
  use_grid_path: true
